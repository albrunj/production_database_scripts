Assembly GUI
============

This provides a GUI for assembling components onto assemblies.

You will need PyQt5 installed, for instance with (on CentOS7):

```bash
sudo yum install python36-qt5
```

Or (if using a different python, but Qt5 is already available):

```bash
pip3 install PyQt5
```

Run with:

```bash
python3 ComponentAssemblyGui.py
```
